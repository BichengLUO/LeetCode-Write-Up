\subsection{237. Delete Node in a Linked List}

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{Mahogany}{Description}}
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is $1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4$ and you are given the third node with value 3, the linked list should become $1 -> 2 -> 4$ after calling your function.

\underline{Code Hints}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Actually we cannot remove a node in a singly linked list without its previous node. However, we can see this problem in two aspects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Remove an arbitrary node in the linked list to shorten it.
        \item Correct the values of each node in the new linked list as if the node to be deleted has been truly removed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{206. Reverse Linked List}

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{Mahogany}{Description}}
Reverse a singly linked list.

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{OliveGreen}{Solution}}
Recursive Method:
$$R(l[1,\cdots])=\{R(l[2,\cdots]),l[1]\}$$
where $R(l)$ denotes the reversed list of $l$, $l[i,\cdots]$ denotes a linked list which starts with the $i^{th}$ element of the list $l$.

Iterative Method:
