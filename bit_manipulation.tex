\section{Bit Manipulation}

\subsection{136. Single Number}

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{Mahogany}{Description}}
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{OliveGreen}{Solution}}
$$a\text{ XOR }0 = a$$
$$a\text{ XOR }a = 0$$

\subsection{371. Sum of Two Integers}

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{Mahogany}{Description}}
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{OliveGreen}{Solution}}
$$a+b=(a\text{ Bitwise XOR }b) + 2\times(a\text{ Bitwise AND }b)$$

\subsection{191. Number of 1 Bits}

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{Mahogany}{Description}}
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of `1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer `11' has binary representation

00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

\paragraph{\color{white} \colorbox{OliveGreen}{Solution}}
$n\text{ Bitwise AND }(n-1)$ can take the last bit of `1' in $n$.
